# WAMCalc
WAMCalc is an iOS app that uses Core Data to calculate your grade (weighted average mark) based on the subjects submitted. I have used this project as a way to practice my SwiftUI development and to learn about Core Data. A tutorial for this app's development will be added to my website so that it may be able to help others that want to learn about using Core Data in SwiftUI.

The app was designed with my specific university in mind. My university uses a grade system of (fail, pass, credit, distinction, high distinction).

## Run
To run this project, feel free to clone this repo and run it on a simulator or physical device. Input your subject name in the subject name field and then select the number of credit points and then your final grade for the subject. Once submitted it will calculate your WAM value and your overall grade.

## License
This project is created with the MIT license. So feel free to do whatever you want with the app.

## Link
I will add a link soon when I have the writeup on the development of the app.
